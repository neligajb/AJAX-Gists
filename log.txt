Tasks: Installed Python and GJSlint on the command line, which took about 1 hour to troubleshoot and install correctly. Set up my Git repository and cloned Assignment 3 into my personal repo — this took about 30 mins to troubleshoot.  Took a 1 hour break, then dove into the assignment and finished functions.js and objects.js. Total time once assignment work began was approximately 4.5 hours.  This time was spent roughly 25% coding and 75% research and debugging a wide variety of general topics.  The objects.js assignment required more time, but was not notably more strenuous than variables.js.
